# Multiple State Menagement

This project is a simple to-do list in flutter.
I wanted to try out different state management so I did.
It's the same application in 3 different branches, with different approaches to state management.


# Running the project
- main branch: state management with Mobx package.
- bloc branch: state management with Bloc and Flutter Bloc packages.
- provider branch: state management with ChangeNotifier and Provider package.



# App Overview

This is a simple to-do list where you can add new todo to the list using an add button and a text field.
